"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Let's confirm the steps and calculations:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, denoted as \( x \).
- The other three angles are each equal to the sum of the two acute angles, which means each of these angles is \( 2x \).

### Step 2: Sum of Interior Angles
- The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180
\]
For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 3: Setting Up the Equation
- The total sum of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540
\]
\[
8x = 540
\]

### Step 4: Solving for \( x \)
- Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 5: Finding the Common Measure of the Large Angles
- The measure of each of the three larger angles is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]

### Summary of Approaches
- The algebraic formulation is correct and leads to the right conclusion.
- The geometric reasoning aligns with the properties of the angles.
- The systematic trial-and-error method would yield the same results, confirming the solution.

All calculations are mathematically correct, and the solution directly addresses the problem statement. The final answer is clearly stated and formatted correctly. Therefore, the solution is confirmed to be accurate.","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.020888999999999994

label(""$n-1$"",(2.5,2.5));
[/asy]","The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement regarding the magic square. Let's confirm the calculations and the logic step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Rows

The magic square is represented as follows:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
n+1 & 1 & n-1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sums of Each Row

- **Row 1**: 
  \[
  S_1 = (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
  \]

- **Row 2**: 
  \[
  S_2 = 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
  \]

- **Row 3**: 
  \[
  S_3 = (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
  \]

### Step 3: Set Up Equations

Since the sums of each row must be equal, we can set up the following equations:

1. From Row 1 and Row 2:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

2. From Row 1 and Row 3 (which we already see are equal):
   \[
   2n + 1 = 2n + 1 \quad \text{(always true)}
   \]

3. From Row 2 and Row 3:
   \[
   3n - 6 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 4: Solve the Equations

#### Solving \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies n = 7
\]

#### Solving \( 3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \):

\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

In both equations, we consistently find that the value of \( n \) is \( 7 \).

### Final Verification

To ensure that this value satisfies the magic square condition, we can substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the sums:

- **Row 1**:
  \[
  S_1 = (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
  \]

- **Row 2**:
  \[
  S_2 = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
  \]

- **Row 3**:
  \[
  S_3 = (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
  \]

All rows sum to \( 15 \), confirming that the magic square condition is satisfied.

### Final Result

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \( \boxed{7} \). 

The solution is accurate, and all calculations are correct.","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","The refined solution is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Here’s a confirmation of the calculations and reasoning:

### Step-by-Step Review

1. **Work Rate of Good Workers**:
   - Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours, so their work rate is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one good worker} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ of the house per hour}
     \]

2. **Work Rate of Bad Workers**:
   - Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours, so their work rate is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one bad worker} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ of the house per hour}
     \]

3. **Total Work Rate of Good Workers**:
   - With 3 good workers, the total work rate is:
     \[
     \text{Total work rate of good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour}
     \]

4. **Required Work Rate**:
   - To finish the house in 3 hours, the required work rate is:
     \[
     \text{Required work rate} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ of the house per hour}
     \]

5. **Remaining Work Rate Needed from Bad Workers**:
   - The work rate needed from bad workers is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate needed from bad workers} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4}
     \]
   - Finding a common denominator (12):
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
     \]
   - Thus,
     \[
     \text{Work rate needed from bad workers} = \frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ of the house per hour}
     \]

6. **Calculating Number of Bad Workers Needed**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers needed. The total work rate from \( x \) bad workers is:
     \[
     x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{x}{36}
     \]
   - Setting this equal to the required work rate:
     \[
     \frac{x}{36} = \frac{1}{12}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 36 \times \frac{1}{12} = 3
     \]

### Conclusion

The calculations are correct, and the reasoning is sound. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\] 

This confirms that you need **3 bad workers** to complete the painting of the house in the required time.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.027172949999999987
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's carefully review the refined solution step by step to ensure its accuracy.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization

The prime factorization of 715 is correctly calculated as:

\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Mapping Prime Factors to Letters

The mapping of the prime factors to letters is also correct:

- \( 5 \) corresponds to \( E \)
- \( 11 \) corresponds to \( K \)
- \( 13 \) corresponds to \( M \)

### Step 3: Forming Potential Words

From the letters derived from the prime factors, we have \( E, K, M \). The word ""EKM"" is formed, but we need to check for valid English words.

### Step 4: Validating Against Common Words

The combinations of the letters \( E, K, M \) are:

- EKM
- EMK
- KEM
- KME
- MEK
- MKE

### Step 5: Checking Each Combination

The solution states that none of the combinations are valid English words. However, it later claims that ""MEK"" is a valid word. This is inconsistent because ""MEK"" is not a recognized common English word. 

### Step 6: Brute Force Word Evaluation

The calculation for the product value of ""MEK"" is correct:

\[
\text{Product} = 13 \times 5 \times 11 = 715
\]

However, since ""MEK"" is not a valid English word, we need to find another word that has a product value of 715.

### Finding a Valid Word

To find a valid English word with a product value of 715, we can consider other combinations of letters that yield the same product. 

After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""ME"" (M = 13, E = 5) combined with ""K"" (K = 11) gives us:

\[
\text{Product} = 13 \times 5 \times 11 = 715
\]

However, ""MEK"" is not a valid English word. 

### Conclusion

Since the solution incorrectly identifies ""MEK"" as a valid word, we need to conclude that the refined solution is incorrect. 

To summarize, the correct approach would involve checking a broader list of common words or combinations that yield the product value of 715. 

After further investigation, a valid word that has a product value of 715 is ""KEM"" (K = 11, E = 5, M = 13), which is a recognized word in some contexts (e.g., a name or abbreviation).

Thus, the final answer should be:

\[
\boxed{\text{KEM}}
\] 

This word is more appropriate as it is recognized in certain contexts, although it may not be a common English word in everyday usage.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.03941715

   \[
   14.7923412^2 \approx 219.0
   \]
   This calculation is correct.

2. **Round to the Nearest Hundred**:

   \]

3. **Estimate the Position**:
   The reasoning that \( 14.7923412^2 \) is closer to \( 225 \) but still less is valid.

4. **Interpolate**:
   The estimate that \( 14.7923412^2 \approx 219 \) is consistent with previous calculations.

5. **Round to the Nearest Hundred**:

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\] 

The solution is accurate, and all calculations and reasoning are consistent and correct.","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200.

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Let's confirm the calculations step-by-step to ensure everything is mathematically sound.

### Given Information
- The area of the square is \(49\) square inches.

### Step 1: Calculate the Side Length of the Square
The side length \(s\) of the square is calculated as follows:
\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of each triangle are half the side length of the square.

### Step 3: Calculate the Legs of the Triangle
Each leg of the triangle is:
\[
\text{leg} = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle is:
\[
h = \sqrt{\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{2 \cdot (3.5)^2} = 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is:
\[
P = \text{leg} + \text{leg} + h = 3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5\sqrt{2} = 7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

### Conclusion
The perimeter of one of the triangles formed by the fold is:
\[
\boxed{7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}}
\]

### Verification of Units and Assumptions
- The units of measurement are consistent throughout the solution (inches).
- The assumption that the triangles formed are right triangles is valid, as folding the square in this manner creates two congruent right triangles.

### Final Confirmation
All calculations are correct, and the solution directly addresses the problem statement. The final answer is clearly stated in the required format. Thus, the solution is accurate. 

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.02665079999999999

How many handshakes are there in total?","The refined solution provided is accurate and logically sound. Let's review the steps to ensure all calculations and reasoning are correct.

### Step-by-Step Review:

1. **Identify the Players**:
   - There are 3 teams with 4 players each.
   - Total players: 
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12
     \]

2. **Handshakes with Opposing Teams**:
   - Each player shakes hands with every player from the 2 opposing teams (4 players each).
   - Total opposing players:
     \[
     4 + 4 = 8
     \]
   - Each handshake occurs 3 times:
     \[
     3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

3. **Handshakes with Own Team**:
   - Each player shakes hands with the other 3 players on their own team once:
     \[
     3
     \]

4. **Total Handshakes per Player**:
   - Adding both types of handshakes:
     \[
     24 + 3 = 27
     \]

5. **Total Handshakes for All Players**:
   - Total handshakes for all players:
     \[
     27 \times 12 = 324
     \]

6. **Adjust for Double Counting**:
   - Each handshake is counted twice, so we divide by 2:
     \[
     \frac{324}{2} = 162

   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 120\)
   - \(2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5) = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 120\)

   All these combinations yield \(120\), confirming that adding 1 gives \(121\).

4. **Explore Other Combinations**: The exploration of combinations that involve addition is also valid:
   - \((2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 100\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) + (4 \cdot 5) = 26\)
   - \(2 + (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 62\)
   - \(2 + ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5) = 62\)

"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Let's confirm the calculations and reasoning step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the Features and Their Options

- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus 1 for bald) → Total = 4
- **Eyebrows**: 2 options → Total = 2
- **Eyes**: 1 option (googly eyes) → Total = 1
- **Ears**: 2 options → Total = 2
- **Lips**: 2 options → Total = 2
- **Shoes**: 2 options (1 pair of regular shoes + 1 pair of clown shoes) → Total = 2

### Step 2: Calculate Total Options for Each Feature

The total options for each feature have been correctly identified as follows:
- Hairstyles: 4
- Eyebrows: 2
- Eyes: 1
- Ears: 2
- Lips: 2
- Shoes: 2

### Step 3: Multiply the Options

The formula for calculating the total number of different personalities is correctly stated as:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = \text{Total Hairstyles} \times \text{Total Eyebrows} \times \text{Total Eyes} \times \text{Total Ears} \times \text{Total Lips} \times \text{Total Shoes}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation

The calculations are performed step-by-step as follows:

1. \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)
2. \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \)
3. \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)
4. \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
5. \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \)

### Conclusion

The final answer is correctly stated as:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]

### Summary of Approaches

The solution effectively uses combinatorial counting to arrive at the total number of different wacky personalities. The reasoning is clear, and the calculations are accurate.

Thus, the original solution is confirmed to be correct, and the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.027625349999999986
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Here’s a confirmation of the solution's correctness, along with a restatement of the final answer.

### Problem Breakdown
We are tasked with finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0'. The range of interest is from 100 to 999, as these are the three-digit numbers.

### Approaches Reviewed
1. **Direct Enumeration**: The code correctly counts the numbers with exactly one '0' by iterating through the range and checking each number.
2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The breakdown of cases for the position of '0' is accurate:
   - Case 1: '0' in the tens place (B) gives \(9 \times 9 = 81\).
   - Case 2: '0' in the units place (C) also gives \(9 \times 9 = 81\).
   - Total from both cases is \(81 + 81 = 162\).
3. **Digit Analysis**: This approach mirrors the combinatorial counting and confirms the results.

### Conclusion
All calculations are mathematically correct, and the assumptions made (that '0' can only be in the tens or units place) are valid. The final answer is clearly stated.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\] 

The solution is confirmed to be accurate.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.02358209999999999

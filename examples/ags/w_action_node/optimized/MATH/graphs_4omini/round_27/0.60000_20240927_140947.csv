"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Let's confirm the steps and calculations:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, denoted as \( x \).
- The other three angles are each equal to the sum of the two acute angles, which means each of these angles measures \( 2x \).

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
- The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180
\]
For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 3 \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 3: Write the Equation
- The total measure of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540
\]
\[
8x = 540
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
- Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Measure of the Large Angles
- The measure of each of the larger angles is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 6: Final Answer
- Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]

### Verification
- The two acute angles are \( 67.5 \) degrees each.
- The three larger angles are \( 135 \) degrees each.
- The total sum of the angles is:
\[
2(67.5) + 3(135) = 135 + 405 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]
This confirms that the calculations are correct and consistent with the properties of a pentagon.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\] 

No corrections are needed; the solution is accurate.","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.024607349999999997

1. **Row Sums**:
   - Row 1: \( (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = 2n + 1 \)
   - Row 2: \( 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3n - 6 \)
   - Row 3: \( (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = 2n + 1 \)

   Setting Row 1 equal to Row 2:

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Let's confirm the calculations step-by-step to ensure everything is correct.

### Step-by-Step Review

1. **Define Work Rates**:
   - Good worker's rate: 
     \[
     \text{Work Rate}_{\text{good}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]
   - Bad worker's rate: 
     \[
     \text{Work Rate}_{\text{bad}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate Total Work Done by Good Workers**:
   - With 3 good workers working for 3 hours:
     \[
     \text{Total Work}_{\text{good}} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
     \]

3. **Determine Remaining Work**:
   - Total work needed is 1 house, so:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Work} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
     \]

4. **Calculate Work Done by One Bad Worker**:
   - In 3 hours, one bad worker can complete:
     \[
     \text{Work done by one bad worker in 3 hours} = 3 \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses}
     \]

5. **Calculate Number of Bad Workers Needed**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers. The total work done by \( x \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
     \[
     x \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{x}{12} \text{ houses}
     \]
   - Setting up the equation for the remaining work:
     \[
     \frac{x}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
     \]

### Conclusion
The calculations are correct, and the solution is logically sound. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]

This confirms that 3 bad workers are needed to ensure the house is painted in 3 hours, given the constraints of the problem. All units and assumptions are consistent and valid throughout the solution.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.025486799999999997
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's review the refined solution step-by-step to ensure its accuracy and correctness.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
The prime factorization of 715 is correctly stated as:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Mapping Prime Factors to Letters
The mapping of the prime factors to their respective letters is also correct:
- 5 corresponds to E
- 11 corresponds to K
- 13 corresponds to M

### Step 3: Generating Combinations of Letters
The combinations of the letters E, K, and M are generated correctly:
- Single letters: E, K, M
- Pairs: EK, EM, KE, KM, ME, MK
- Triplet: EKM

### Step 4: Validating Against English Words
The product values for each combination are calculated correctly:
- For E: \( 5 \)
- For K: \( 11 \)
- For M: \( 13 \)
- For EK: \( 5 \times 11 = 55 \)
- For EM: \( 5 \times 13 = 65 \)
- For KE: \( 11 \times 5 = 55 \)
- For KM: \( 11 \times 13 = 143 \)
- For ME: \( 13 \times 5 = 65 \)
- For MK: \( 13 \times 11 = 143 \)
- For EKM: \( 5 \times 11 \times 13 = 715 \)

### Step 5: Identifying Valid Words
The conclusion that EKM is not a common English word is accurate. The mention of ""KEM"" as a less common word is also valid, but it is important to note that ""KEM"" is not widely recognized as a standard English word.

### Conclusion
The solution correctly identifies that the only combination yielding a product value of 715 is EKM, but it does not correspond to a common English word. The mention of ""KEM"" is a valid observation, but it may not meet the criteria of being a ""common"" English word.

### Final Answer
Since the problem asks for a common English word, and ""KEM"" is not widely recognized, we conclude that there is no common English word with a product value of 715 based on the provided letters.

Thus, the final answer should be stated as:
\[
\boxed{\text{No common English word with a product value of 715.}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.0367314
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"Let's carefully review the provided solution for estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred.

### Step 1: Direct Calculation
The calculation of \( 14.7923412^2 \) should be performed accurately. Using a calculator:

\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 219.0
\]

This calculation is correct.

### Step 2: Rounding to the Nearest Hundred
Next, we round \( 219.0 \) to the nearest hundred. The value \( 219.0 \) is indeed closer to \( 200 \) than to \( 300 \), so the rounding is correct:

\[
\text{Rounded value} = 200
\]

### Step 3: Verification Using Prime Factorization
The prime factorization of \( 219 \) is given as \( 3 \times 73 \). While this factorization is correct, it does not directly contribute to the rounding decision. The rounding decision was already made based on the proximity of \( 219.0 \) to \( 200 \) and \( 300 \).

### Step 4: Alternative Estimation
Estimating \( 14.7923412 \) by rounding it to \( 15 \) and calculating \( 15^2 \):

\[
15^2 = 225
\]

Rounding \( 225 \) to the nearest hundred gives:

\[
\text{Rounded value} = 200
\]

This step is also valid and confirms the previous rounding.

### Conclusion
All calculations and reasoning in the solution are correct. The final answer is clearly stated and consistent across different methods of estimation and verification.

Thus, the estimated value of \( 14.7923412^2 \) rounded to the nearest hundred is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\] 

The solution is accurate and does not require any corrections.","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200.

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's review the refined solution step-by-step to ensure its accuracy and correctness.

### Step-by-Step Review

1. **Determine the Side Length of the Square**:
   The area of the square is given as \( 49 \) square inches. The side length \( s \) of the square is calculated as follows:
   \[
   s^2 = 49 \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
   \]
   This calculation is correct.

2. **Understand the Folding Process**:
   When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it indeed creates two congruent right triangles. This understanding is accurate.

3. **Calculate the Length of the Legs of the Triangle**:
   Each leg of the triangle is half the side length of the square:
   \[
   \text{leg length} = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
   \]
   This calculation is also correct.

4. **Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle**:
   Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \( h \) of the triangle is calculated as follows:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{(\text{leg length})^2 + (\text{leg length})^2} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{2 \cdot (3.5)^2} = 3.5\sqrt{2}
   \]
   This calculation is correct.

5. **Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle**:
   The perimeter \( P \) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
   \[
   P = \text{leg length} + \text{leg length} + \text{hypotenuse} = 3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   P = 7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
   \]
   This calculation is correct.

6. **Final Answer**:
   The perimeter of one of the triangles formed by the fold is:
   \[
   \boxed{7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}}
   \]

### Conclusion
The refined solution is accurate, and all calculations are mathematically correct. The final answer is clearly stated in the required format. Thus, the solution is confirmed to be correct.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.025040399999999997
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's carefully review the refined solution step-by-step to ensure its accuracy.

### Step-by-Step Review

1. **Identify the Structure**:
   - There are **3 teams** with **4 players** each.
   - Total number of players:
     \[
     \text{Total Players} = 3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}
     \]
   - This calculation is correct.

2. **Handshakes Within Teams**:
   - Each player shakes hands with their **3 teammates** once.
   - The total handshakes within one team can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Handshakes within one team} = \frac{4 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes}}{2} = 6 \text{ handshakes}
     \]
   - Since there are **3 teams**, the total handshakes within all teams is:
     \[
     \text{Total handshakes within teams} = 6 \text{ handshakes/team} \times 3 \text{ teams} = 18 \text{ handshakes}
     \]
   - This calculation is also correct.

3. **Handshakes Between Teams**:
   - Each player shakes hands with **8 players** from the opposing teams (4 players from each of the 2 opposing teams) **3 times**.
   - The total handshakes for one player with opposing players is:
     \[
     \text{Handshakes with opposing players} = 8 \text{ opposing players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes} = 24 \text{ handshakes}
     \]
   - For all **12 players**, the total handshakes with opposing players is:
     \[
     \text{Total handshakes with opposing players} = 12 \text{ players} \times 24 \text{ handshakes} = 288 \text{ handshakes}
     \]
   - This calculation is correct.

4. **Combine the Results**:
   - The total number of handshakes (both within and between teams) is:
     \[
     \text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes within teams} + \text{Total handshakes with opposing players}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total handshakes} = 18 + 288 = 306
     \]
   - This calculation is correct.

5. **Adjust for Double Counting**:
   - The solution states that each handshake has been counted twice (once for each participant), so it divides the total by 2:
     \[
     \text{Final Total Handshakes} = \frac{306}{2} = 153
     \]
   - However, this adjustment is incorrect. The handshakes have not been counted twice in this context because the calculations for handshakes within teams and between teams are already distinct and do not overlap. Therefore, we do not need to divide by 2.

### Corrected Final Calculation
The total number of handshakes is simply:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 306
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{306}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

2. **Identifying Parentheses Insertion**: The solution correctly states that we can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations.

3. **Calculating Each Configuration**: Each configuration is calculated step-by-step, and all calculations are mathematically correct. Each configuration leads to the same result of \(121\).

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Let's confirm the calculations step-by-step to ensure everything is correct.

### Step-by-Step Review

1. **Identify the Features and Their Options**:
   - **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus 1 bald option, making it 4 total)
   - **Eyebrows**: 2 options
   - **Eyes**: 1 option
   - **Ears**: 2 options
   - **Lips**: 2 options
   - **Shoes**: 2 options (1 pair of regular shoes + 1 pair of clown shoes)

2. **Calculate Combinations Without Hair**:
   The combinations without hair include all features except hairstyles:
   \[
   \text{Combinations without hair} = \text{Eyebrows} \times \text{Eyes} \times \text{Ears} \times \text{Lips} \times \text{Shoes}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Combinations without hair} = 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate Combinations With Hair**:
   To include the hairstyles (including the bald option), we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Combinations with hair} = \text{Hairstyles} \times \text{Combinations without hair}
   \]
   Here, we should use the total number of hairstyles, which is 4 (3 hairstyles + 1 bald):
   \[
   \text{Combinations with hair} = 4 \times 16 = 64
   \]

4. **Total Combinations**:
   The total number of combinations is simply the combinations with hair, as the bald option is already included in the hairstyles:
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = \text{Combinations without hair} + \text{Combinations with hair}
   \]
   However, since the combinations with hair already account for all options, we do not need to add them again. The total number of unique combinations is:
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = 64
   \]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]

### Conclusion
The original solution mistakenly added the combinations without hair to those with hair, which led to an incorrect total. The correct total number of different wacky personalities is \( \boxed{64} \).","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.024204149999999997

The analysis of the two cases is correct:

#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place
- The format \( a0b \) is valid:
  - \( a \) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
  - \( b \) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
  
The total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place
- The format \( ab0 \) is valid:
  - \( a \) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
  - \( b \) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
  
The total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

### Step 4: Total Count
The total count from both cases is:
\[
81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The final answer is correctly stated as:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]

All calculations are mathematically correct, the solution directly addresses the problem statement, and the units of measurement (whole numbers) are consistent throughout. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the solution. 

Thus, the solution is confirmed to be accurate.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.014958149999999998

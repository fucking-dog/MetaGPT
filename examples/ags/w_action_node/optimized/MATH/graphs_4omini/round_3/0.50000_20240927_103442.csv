"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem of finding the common measure of the large angles in the convex pentagon, we will follow a structured approach, ensuring clarity and thoroughness in our calculations.

### Step 1: Define the Angles
Let’s denote the two congruent acute angles as \( x \). Since these angles are acute, we know that:

\[
0 < x < 90^\circ
\]

### Step 2: Define the Other Angles
According to the problem, the measure of each of the other three interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, we can express these angles as:

\[
y = x + x = 2x
\]

### Step 3: Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
\]

For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation
Now we can set up the equation for the sum of the angles in our pentagon. We have two angles of measure \( x \) and three angles of measure \( 2x \):

\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the Equation
Expanding the equation gives:

\[
2x + 6x = 540^\circ
\]

Combining like terms results in:

\[
8x = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the Measure of the Larger Angles
Next, we find the measure of the larger angles \( y \):

\[
y = 2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:

\[
\boxed{135^\circ}
\]

### Verification
To ensure our solution is correct, we can verify by checking the sum of the angles:

- Two angles of \( 67.5^\circ \): \( 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ \)
- Three angles of \( 135^\circ \): \( 3 \times 135^\circ = 405^\circ \)

Adding these together:

\[
135^\circ + 405^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

This matches the calculated sum of the interior angles of a pentagon, confirming that our solution is accurate. The common measure of the large angles is indeed:

\[
\boxed{135^\circ}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",0,0.013900799999999998

[/asy]","To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal. Let's denote the magic constant (the common sum) as \( S \).

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row

The first row is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row

The second row is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row

The third row is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 4: Set the sums of the rows equal to each other

From the first and third rows, we have:
\[
2n + 1 = 2n + 1 \quad \text{(this is always true)}
\]

From the first and second rows, we set them equal:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

Rearranging the equation:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
1 = n - 6
\]
Add \( 6 \) to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

### Step 6: Verify the value of \( n \)

Now we will substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check if all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.

Substituting \( n = 7 \):
- First row: 
\[
7 - 3 = 4, \quad 7 + 2 = 9, \quad 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
- Second row:
\[
3, \quad 2(7) - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5, \quad 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]
- Third row:
\[
7 + 1 = 8, \quad 1, \quad 7 - 1 = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

### Step 7: Check the columns

- First column:
\[
4 + 3 + 8 = 15
\]
- Second column:
\[
9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]
- Third column:
\[
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

### Step 8: Check the diagonals

- Main diagonal:
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
- Other diagonal:
\[
2 + 5 + 8 = 15
\]

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to \( 15 \), the value of \( n \) is confirmed to be correct.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed alongside the 3 good workers to paint the house in 3 hours, we will follow a detailed step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rates of Good and Bad Workers

1. **Good Worker:**
   - A good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Bad Worker:**
   - A bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Work Rate of the Good Workers

Since we have 3 good workers, their combined work rate is:
\[
\text{Total work rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Total Work Needed to Paint the House

The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house.

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Work Rate Needed to Finish in 3 Hours

To finish painting the house in 3 hours, the total work rate required is:
\[
\text{Required work rate} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation for the Total Work Rate

Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers. The total work rate from the bad workers is:
\[
\text{Total work rate of } x \text{ bad workers} = x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{x}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

Now, we can set up the equation for the total work rate:
\[
\text{Total work rate} = \text{Work rate of good workers} + \text{Work rate of bad workers}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)

To solve for \( x \), we first need a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36. We will convert each term to have a denominator of 36:
\[
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{36}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{12}{36}
\]

Now, substituting these values into the equation:
\[
\frac{9}{36} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{12}{36}
\]

Now, we can eliminate the denominators by multiplying through by 36:
\[
9 + x = 12
\]

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives:
\[
x = 12 - 9 = 3
\]

### Conclusion

You need **3 bad workers** in addition to the 3 good workers to paint the house in 3 hours. 

This solution confirms the initial solution and provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the calculations and reasoning involved.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.021242999999999998
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach, starting with the prime factorization of 715 and then relating those factors to the letter values assigned to the letters A through Z.

### Step 1: Factor 715
We begin by finding the prime factorization of 715.

1. **Check divisibility by 5** (the last digit is 5):
   \[
   715 \div 5 = 143
   \]
   Thus, we have:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 143
   \]

2. **Next, factor 143**. We check divisibility by 11:
   - The sum of the digits of 143 is \(1 + 4 + 3 = 8\), which is not divisible by 11.
   - Check divisibility by 13:
   \[
   143 \div 11 = 13
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   143 = 11 \times 13
   \]

Putting it all together, we find:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Relate Factors to Letter Values
Now we need to relate these factors to the letter values:
- A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26
- The values corresponding to our factors are:
  - 5 corresponds to E
  - 11 corresponds to K
  - 13 corresponds to M

### Step 3: Form Words
Now we can form words using the letters E, K, and M. We can use these letters in various combinations to find common English words.

1. **Word Combinations**:
   - The letters E, K, and M can be arranged in various ways. The possible combinations include:
     - E
     - K
     - M
     - ME
     - EK
     - KE
     - EM
     - MK
     - KM
     - KEM
     - MEK
     - EKM
     - etc.

2. **Common English Words**:
   - The most straightforward common English word we can form is ""ME"".
   - However, we also have ""KEM"".

### Step 4: Verify Product Value
Let's verify the product value of the word ""KEM"":
- K = 11
- E = 5
- M = 13

Calculating the product:
\[
\text{Product value of KEM} = 11 \times 5 \times 13
\]
Calculating step-by-step:
1. First, calculate \(11 \times 5\):
   \[
   11 \times 5 = 55
   \]
2. Next, multiply by 13:
   \[
   55 \times 13 = 715
   \]

### Conclusion
The common English word that has a product value of 715 is **KEM**. 

This solution confirms that the initial approach was correct, and we have verified the calculations step-by-step to ensure accuracy.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.017440949999999997
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we can take a different approach while ensuring clarity and accuracy. Here’s a detailed step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Round the Number
First, we need to round \( 14.7923412 \) to a simpler number. We can round it to the nearest whole number. 

- The number \( 14.7923412 \) is closer to \( 15 \) than to \( 14 \) since \( 14.7923412 \) is greater than \( 14.5 \).
- Therefore, we round \( 14.7923412 \) to \( 15 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the Square of the Rounded Number
Next, we calculate the square of the rounded number \( 15 \):

\[
15^2 = 15 \times 15 = 225
\]

### Step 3: Estimate to the Nearest Hundred
Now, we need to round \( 225 \) to the nearest hundred:

- The hundreds around \( 225 \) are \( 200 \) and \( 300 \).
- Since \( 225 \) is closer to \( 200 \) (as \( 225 - 200 = 25 \) and \( 300 - 225 = 75 \)), we round \( 225 \) down to \( 200 \).

### Step 4: Final Answer
Thus, the estimate of \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]

### Alternative Approach: Using a Different Rounding Strategy
Let’s explore another method by rounding to a different level of precision before squaring.

### Step 1: Round to One Decimal Place
Instead of rounding to a whole number, we can round \( 14.7923412 \) to one decimal place:

- Rounding \( 14.7923412 \) to one decimal place gives us \( 14.8 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the Square of the Rounded Number
Now, we calculate the square of \( 14.8 \):

\[
14.8^2 = (14.8)(14.8)
\]

To calculate \( 14.8^2 \), we can use the formula \( (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \), where \( a = 14 \) and \( b = 0.8 \):

\[
14.8^2 = (14 + 0.8)^2 = 14^2 + 2 \cdot 14 \cdot 0.8 + 0.8^2
\]

Calculating each term:

- \( 14^2 = 196 \)
- \( 2 \cdot 14 \cdot 0.8 = 22.4 \)
- \( 0.8^2 = 0.64 \)

Now, summing these values:

\[
14.8^2 = 196 + 22.4 + 0.64 = 219.04
\]

### Step 3: Estimate to the Nearest Hundred
Now we round \( 219.04 \) to the nearest hundred:

- The nearest hundreds are \( 200 \) and \( 300 \).
- Since \( 219.04 \) is closer to \( 200 \), we round it down to \( 200 \).

### Final Answer
Thus, using this alternative method, we also find that the estimate of \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]

Both methods confirm that the estimate is \( 200 \).","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200. Therefore, the square of any number between 14 and 15 will also be $\boxed{200},$ when rounded to the nearest hundred.",1,0.0229044
"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem of finding the perimeter of one of the triangles formed when a square piece of paper is folded, we will follow a detailed step-by-step approach, ensuring clarity and accuracy.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square

The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The formula for the area \(A\) of a square is:

\[
A = s^2
\]

where \(s\) is the side length of the square. Setting the area equal to \(49\):

\[
s^2 = 49
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process

When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, we can visualize this as folding the square along the diagonal. This fold creates two congruent right triangles.

### Step 3: Determine the Dimensions of the Triangles Formed

Each triangle formed by the fold has:
- One leg equal to the side length of the square, which is \(7\) inches.
- The other leg is also equal to the side length of the square, which is \(7\) inches.

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle

The hypotenuse \(h\) of each triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
h = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the legs. Here, both legs are \(7\) inches:

\[
h = \sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = \sqrt{49 \cdot 2} = 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle

The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:

\[
P = a + b + h
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 6: Final Answer

The perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}
\]

This solution confirms the initial solution's correctness and provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the calculations involved.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.02251425
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break it down into clear steps, ensuring we account for both the handshakes within teams and those between opposing teams.

### Step 1: Identify the Teams and Players
We have:
- 3 teams
- Each team has 4 players

Thus, the total number of players is:
\[
3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}
\]

### Step 2: Handshakes Within the Same Team
Each player shakes hands once with every member of their own team. For a single team of 4 players, the number of unique handshakes can be calculated using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of players in the team:
\[
\text{Handshakes within one team} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]
Since there are 3 teams, the total number of handshakes within all teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes within teams} = 3 \text{ teams} \times 6 \text{ handshakes/team} = 18
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes Between Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands 3 times with every member of the opposing teams. Each team has 4 players, and since there are 2 opposing teams for each team, the number of players in the opposing teams is:
\[
4 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ opposing teams} = 8 \text{ opposing players}
\]
Each player shakes hands 3 times with each of these 8 players, so the total number of handshakes for one player with the opposing teams is:
\[
3 \text{ handshakes/player} \times 8 \text{ opposing players} = 24 \text{ handshakes/player}
\]
Since there are 12 players in total, the total number of handshakes between opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes between teams} = 12 \text{ players} \times 24 \text{ handshakes/player} = 288
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Handshakes
Now, we can find the total number of handshakes by adding the handshakes within teams and the handshakes between opposing teams:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes within teams} + \text{Total handshakes between teams}
\]
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 18 + 288 = 306
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes that occur at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{306}
\] 

This detailed breakdown confirms the accuracy of the initial solution while providing a clear step-by-step explanation of the calculations involved.","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

Calculating this directly gives:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6, \quad 6 \cdot 4 = 24, \quad 24 \cdot 5 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
\]

### Step 2: Explore Parenthetical Groupings

We can group the multiplications in various ways. The key is to consider how we can combine the numbers and then add 1 at the end. Here are the possible groupings:

1. **All together**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121
   \]

2. **Group the first two, then the last two**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

3. **Group the first three, then multiply by the last**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

4. **Group the last three, then multiply by the first**:
   \[
   2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

5. **Group the first two, then the last two, and add**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

6. **Group the first and last, and the middle two**:
   \[
   2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

### Step 3: Explore Combinations with Addition

Now, we can also consider combinations where we add before multiplying:

1. **Add before multiplying**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot (5 + 1)) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 6) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 24 = 144
   \]

2. **Add after grouping**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot (5 + 1) = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 6 = 24 \cdot 6 = 144
   \]

3. **Different combinations of additions**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 6 \cdot (20 + 1) = 6 \cdot 21 = 126
   \]

4. **Another combination**:
   \[
   (2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 5 \cdot 20 + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101
   \]

### Step 4: Collect All Unique Results

From our calculations, we have obtained the following unique results:
- \(121\)
- \(144\)
- \(126\)
- \(101\)

### Conclusion

After exploring all possible groupings and combinations, we find that the unique values obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses are:

- \(121\)
- \(144\)
- \(126\)
- \(101\)

Thus, the total number of distinct values that can be obtained is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",1,0.024203099999999998
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will break down the components and calculate the total combinations step-by-step, ensuring clarity and thoroughness.

### Components and Choices:
1. **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus the option to be bald).
2. **Eyebrows**: 2 sets.
3. **Eyes**: 1 pair (googly eyes).
4. **Ears**: 2 sets.
5. **Lips**: 2 sets.
6. **Shoes**: 2 options (regular shoes and clown shoes).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Hairstyles**:
   - Tom has 3 hairstyles. Additionally, he can choose to be bald. Therefore, the total options for hairstyles = 3 (hairstyles) + 1 (bald) = **4 options**.

2. **Eyebrows**:
   - Tom has 2 sets of eyebrows. Therefore, the total options for eyebrows = **2 options**.

3. **Eyes**:
   - Tom has 1 pair of googly eyes. Therefore, the total options for eyes = **1 option**.

4. **Ears**:
   - Tom has 2 sets of ears. Therefore, the total options for ears = **2 options**.

5. **Lips**:
   - Tom has 2 sets of lips. Therefore, the total options for lips = **2 options**.

6. **Shoes**:
   - Tom has 2 options for shoes (regular shoes and clown shoes). Therefore, the total options for shoes = **2 options**.

### Total Combinations:
To find the total number of different wacky personalities, we multiply the number of options for each component together:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting in the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication step-by-step:

1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can come up with is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]

### Conclusion:
By systematically analyzing each component and calculating the total combinations, we confirm that Tom can create **64 different wacky personalities** with his Mr. Potato Head. This methodical approach ensures that all possibilities are accounted for, including the option to be bald.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.015581399999999997
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we will analyze the three-digit numbers in the range from 100 to 999. 

### Step 1: Understand the structure of three-digit numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 2: Identify the cases for having exactly one 0
To have exactly one 0 in the number \(abc\), we can have the following cases:
1. The 0 is in the tens place (\(a0c\)).
2. The 0 is in the units place (\(ab0\)).

### Case 1: 0 in the tens place (\(a0c\))
- **Choosing \(a\)**: The hundreds digit \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9. This gives us 9 options for \(a\).
- **Choosing \(c\)**: The units digit \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (it cannot be 0 to ensure we have exactly one 0). This gives us 9 options for \(c\).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } c\text{)} = 81.
\]

### Case 2: 0 in the units place (\(ab0\))
- **Choosing \(a\)**: The hundreds digit \(a\) can again be any digit from 1 to 9. This gives us 9 options for \(a\).
- **Choosing \(b\)**: The tens digit \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (it cannot be 0 to ensure we have exactly one 0). This gives us 9 options for \(b\).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } b\text{)} = 81.
\]

### Step 3: Combine the results
Now, we add the results from both cases to find the total number of three-digit numbers that contain exactly one 0:
\[
81 \text{ (from case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from case 2)} = 162.
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one 0 is \(\boxed{162}\). 

This solution confirms the initial solution provided, ensuring that all calculations and reasoning are clear and accurate.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.014223599999999998

"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem of finding the common measure of the larger angles in a convex pentagon with specific angle properties, we will follow a structured approach. 

### Step 1: Define the Angles
Let’s denote the two congruent acute angles as \( x \). Since they are acute, we know:
\[
0 < x < 90^\circ
\]

The problem states that each of the other three interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, we can denote the measures of the three larger angles as \( y \):
\[
y = x + x = 2x
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of Interior Angles
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
Now, we can express the total sum of the angles in terms of \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
2x + 3y = 540^\circ
\]
Substituting \( y = 2x \) into the equation gives:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540^\circ
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
8x = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

### Step 6: Find \( y \)
Now that we have \( x \), we can find \( y \):
\[
y = 2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

### Step 7: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we will check the sum of the angles:
- Two acute angles: \( 67.5^\circ + 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ \)
- Three larger angles: \( 135^\circ + 135^\circ + 135^\circ = 405^\circ \)

Adding these together:
\[
135^\circ + 405^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

This confirms that our calculations are correct.

### Conclusion
Thus, the common measure of the larger angles \( y \) is:
\[
\boxed{135^\circ}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",0,0.020662800000000002

label(""$n-1$"",(2.5,2.5));
[/asy]","To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we will analyze the structure of the square and derive the necessary equations step-by-step. 

### Step 1: Set Up the Magic Square

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Magic Constant \( S \)

In a magic square, the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal must be equal. We will denote this common sum as \( S \).

### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of Each Row

1. **First Row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Second Row:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Third Row:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 4: Set Up Equations

Since all rows must sum to the same value \( S \), we can set the equations equal to each other:

From the first row:
\[
S = 2n + 1
\]

From the second row:
\[
S = 3n - 6
\]

Setting these equal gives:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

Rearranging the equation:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
\]

Thus, we find:
\[
n = 7
\]

### Step 6: Verify the Value of \( n \)

Now we will substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check if all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.

Substituting \( n = 7 \):
- **First Row:**
  \[
  7 - 3 = 4, \quad 7 + 2 = 9, \quad 2
  \]
  Sum: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)

- **Second Row:**
  \[
  3, \quad 2(7) - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5, \quad 7
  \]
  Sum: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)

- **Third Row:**
  \[
  7 + 1 = 8, \quad 1, \quad 7 - 1 = 6
  \]
  Sum: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

### Step 7: Check the Columns

- **First Column:**
  \[
  4 + 3 + 8 = 15
  \]

- **Second Column:**
  \[
  9 + 5 + 1 = 15
  \]

- **Third Column:**
  \[
  2 + 7 + 6 = 15
  \]

### Step 8: Check the Diagonals

- **Main Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):**
  \[
  4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  \]

- **Other Diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):**
  \[
  2 + 5 + 8 = 15
  \]

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to \( 15 \), we confirm that our value for \( n \) is correct.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed alongside the 3 good workers to paint the house in 3 hours, we will follow a detailed step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rates of Good and Bad Workers

1. **Good Worker:**
   - A good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Bad Worker:**
   - A bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Work Rate of the Good Workers

Since we have 3 good workers, their combined work rate is:
\[
\text{Total work rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Total Work Needed to Paint the House

The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house.

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Work Rate Needed to Finish in 3 Hours

To finish painting the house in 3 hours, the total work rate required is:
\[
\text{Required work rate} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation for the Total Work Rate

Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers. The total work rate from the bad workers is:
\[
\text{Total work rate of } x \text{ bad workers} = x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{x}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

Now, we can set up the equation for the total work rate:
\[
\text{Total work rate} = \text{Work rate of good workers} + \text{Work rate of bad workers}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)

To solve for \( x \), we first need a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36. We will convert each term to have a denominator of 36:
\[
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{36}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{12}{36}
\]

Now, substituting these values into the equation:
\[
\frac{9}{36} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{12}{36}
\]

Now, we can eliminate the denominators by multiplying through by 36:
\[
9 + x = 12
\]

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives:
\[
x = 12 - 9 = 3
\]

### Conclusion

You need **3 bad workers** in addition to the 3 good workers to paint the house in 3 hours. 

This solution confirms the initial solution and provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the calculations and reasoning involved.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.01873785
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach, starting with the prime factorization of 715 and then mapping those factors to letter values.

### Step 1: Factor 715
We begin by finding the prime factorization of 715.

1. **Check divisibility by 5** (the last digit is 5):
   \[
   715 \div 5 = 143
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 143
   \]

2. **Next, factor 143**. Check divisibility by 11:
   \[
   143 \div 11 = 13
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   143 = 11 \times 13
   \]

Putting it all together, we find:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Map Factors to Letter Values
Now we need to map these factors to the corresponding letter values:
- \(5\) corresponds to the letter \(E\) (5th letter).
- \(11\) corresponds to the letter \(K\) (11th letter).
- \(13\) corresponds to the letter \(M\) (13th letter).

### Step 3: Form Possible Words
Now we can form words using the letters \(E\), \(K\), and \(M\). The letters can be arranged in different combinations. 

1. **Three-letter combinations**:
   - The letters can be arranged as:
     - EKM
     - EMK
     - KEM
     - KME
     - MEK
     - MKE

2. **Check for common English words**:
   - Among the combinations, ""EKM"", ""EMK"", ""KEM"", ""KME"", ""MEK"", and ""MKE"" do not form common English words.

### Step 4: Check for Longer Words
Since we are looking for common English words, we can also consider longer combinations or different arrangements of the letters. 

However, the letters \(E\), \(K\), and \(M\) do not seem to form any common English words when combined in various ways.

### Step 5: Explore Other Combinations
We can also consider combinations of letters that might yield a product value of 715 but use different letters. 

1. **Check other combinations**:
   - The product value can also be achieved by using different letters. For example, we can check combinations of letters that multiply to 715:
     - \(7 \times 5 \times 11 = 715\)
     - \(7\) corresponds to \(G\) (7th letter).
     - \(5\) corresponds to \(E\) (5th letter).
     - \(11\) corresponds to \(K\) (11th letter).

   This gives us the letters \(G\), \(E\), and \(K\).

2. **Form possible words**:
   - The letters can be arranged as:
     - GEK
     - GKE
     - EKG
     - EKC
     - KGE
     - KEG

3. **Check for common English words**:
   - Among these combinations, ""KEG"" is a common English word.

### Conclusion
After checking the combinations of the letters corresponding to the factors of 715, we find that the common English word with a product value of 715 is **""KEG""**. 

Thus, the answer to the problem is:
**The common English word with a product value of 715 is ""KEG"".**","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.0191937
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we can follow a systematic approach that may differ from the initial solution while still ensuring accuracy. Here’s a detailed step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Round the Number
First, we need to round \( 14.7923412 \) to a simpler number. We can round it to the nearest whole number. 

- The number \( 14.7923412 \) is closer to \( 15 \) than to \( 14 \) because \( 14.7923412 \) is greater than \( 14.5 \).

Thus, we round \( 14.7923412 \) to \( 15 \).

### Step 2: Square the Rounded Number
Next, we calculate the square of the rounded number \( 15 \):

\[
15^2 = 15 \times 15 = 225
\]

### Step 3: Estimate to the Nearest Hundred
Now, we need to determine if \( 225 \) is closer to \( 200 \) or \( 300 \).

- The midpoint between \( 200 \) and \( 300 \) is \( 250 \).
- Since \( 225 \) is less than \( 250 \), it is closer to \( 200 \).

### Step 4: Final Answer
Therefore, the estimate of \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]

### Alternative Approach: Direct Calculation

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem of finding the perimeter of one of the triangles formed when a square piece of paper is folded, we will follow a detailed step-by-step approach, ensuring clarity and accuracy throughout the process.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square

The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The formula for the area \(A\) of a square is:

\[
A = s^2
\]

where \(s\) is the side length of the square. Setting the area equal to \(49\):

\[
s^2 = 49
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process

When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, we can visualize this as folding the square along the diagonal. The corners that coincide are the two opposite corners of the square.

### Step 3: Determine the Dimensions of the Triangles Formed

The fold creates two congruent right triangles. Each triangle has:

- One leg equal to the side length of the square, \(s = 7\) inches.
- The other leg also equal to the side length of the square, \(s = 7\) inches.

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle

The hypotenuse \(h\) of each triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
h = \sqrt{s^2 + s^2} = \sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle

The perimeter \(P\) of one of the right triangles is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:

\[
P = \text{leg}_1 + \text{leg}_2 + \text{hypotenuse} = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2}
\]

Simplifying this, we have:

\[
P = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 6: Final Answer

The perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}
\]

This solution confirms the initial calculations and reasoning, ensuring that all steps are clearly articulated and accurate.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.012133800000000002
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break it down into clear steps, considering both the handshakes within teams and those between opposing teams.

### Step 1: Identify the number of teams and players
We have:
- 3 teams
- Each team has 4 players

Thus, the total number of players is:
\[
3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}
\]

### Step 2: Handshakes within the same team
Each player shakes hands once with each member of their own team. For a single team of 4 players, the number of unique handshakes can be calculated using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which counts the number of ways to choose 2 players from \( n \) players.

For one team:
\[
\text{Handshakes within one team} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]

Since there are 3 teams, the total number of handshakes within all teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes within teams} = 3 \text{ teams} \times 6 \text{ handshakes/team} = 18
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes with opposing teams
Each player shakes hands 3 times with every member of the opposing teams. Each player has 2 opposing teams, and each opposing team has 4 players. Therefore, the total number of players in the opposing teams is:
\[
2 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 8 \text{ opposing players}
\]

Each player shakes hands 3 times with each of these 8 opposing players, so the total number of handshakes for one player with opposing players is:
\[
3 \text{ handshakes/player} \times 8 \text{ opposing players} = 24 \text{ handshakes}
\]

Since there are 12 players in total, the total number of handshakes with opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes with opposing teams} = 12 \text{ players} \times 24 \text{ handshakes/player} = 288
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of handshakes
Now, we can find the total number of handshakes by adding the handshakes within teams and the handshakes with opposing teams:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes within teams} + \text{Total handshakes with opposing teams}
\]
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 18 + 288 = 306
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes that occur during the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{306}

#### Grouping Options

1. **No Parentheses (default order)**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121.
   \]

2. **Group the first two terms**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

3. **Group the first three terms**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

4. **Group the last two terms**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

5. **Group the first and last terms**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

6. **Group the first two and add 5**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 + 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 4 + 5 + 1 = 24 + 5 + 1 = 30.
   \]

7. **Group the first and second terms, then add 5**:
   \[
   2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 2 \cdot 12 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

8. **Group the last two terms and add 1**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 + 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 9 + 1 = 54 + 1 = 55.
   \]

9. **Group all terms**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

10. **Group the first and last terms, then add 1**:
    \[
    2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1)) = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 21) = 126.
    \]

### Step 3: Summary of Results

From the calculations above, we have obtained the following distinct values:

- \(121\) (from multiple configurations)
- \(30\) (from grouping \(2 \cdot 3\) and adding \(5 + 1\))
- \(55\) (from grouping \(4 + 5\))
- \(126\) (from grouping \(4 \cdot 5 + 1\))

### Conclusion

The distinct values obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses are \(121\), \(30\), \(55\), and \(126\). 

Thus, the total number of distinct values that can be obtained is:

\[
\boxed{4}.
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",1,0.02342955
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will break down the components and choices step-by-step, ensuring clarity and thoroughness in our calculations.

### Components and Choices:
1. **Hairstyles**: Tom has 3 hairstyles to choose from, plus the option to be bald. This gives us:
   - **Total choices for hairstyles**: \(3 + 1 = 4\)

2. **Eyebrows**: There are 2 sets of eyebrows available. Thus:
   - **Total choices for eyebrows**: \(2\)

3. **Eyes**: There is only 1 pair of googly eyes. Therefore:
   - **Total choices for eyes**: \(1\)

4. **Ears**: Tom has 2 sets of ears to choose from. Hence:
   - **Total choices for ears**: \(2\)

5. **Lips**: There are 2 sets of lips available. So:
   - **Total choices for lips**: \(2\)

6. **Shoes**: Tom has 2 options for shoes (regular shoes and clown shoes). Thus:
   - **Total choices for shoes**: \(2\)

### Total Combinations:
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of choices for each component together:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Choices for Hair}) \times (\text{Choices for Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Choices for Eyes}) \times (\text{Choices for Ears}) \times (\text{Choices for Lips}) \times (\text{Choices for Shoes})
\]

Substituting in the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step-by-Step Multiplication:
Now, we will perform the multiplication step-by-step:

1. **First Step**: Calculate \(4 \times 2\):
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8
   \]

2. **Second Step**: Multiply the result by the choices for eyes:
   \[
   8 \times 1 = 8
   \]

3. **Third Step**: Multiply by the choices for ears:
   \[
   8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

4. **Fourth Step**: Multiply by the choices for lips:
   \[
   16 \times 2 = 32
   \]

5. **Fifth Step**: Finally, multiply by the choices for shoes:
   \[
   32 \times 2 = 64
   \]

### Conclusion:
Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\] 

This thorough breakdown confirms the accuracy of the initial solution and provides a clear understanding of how the total was derived.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.0242718
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we will analyze the three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999) since 99 is not a three-digit number and cannot contain a 0.

### Step 1: Define the Range
The numbers we are interested in are from 100 to 999. This gives us a total of 900 three-digit numbers.

### Step 2: Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds place (1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens place (0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units place (0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One 0
To have exactly one 0 in the number \(abc\), we can have the following cases:
1. \(b = 0\) (the tens place is 0).
2. \(c = 0\) (the units place is 0).

### Case 1: \(b = 0\)
- The number takes the form \(a0c\).
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options, since it cannot be 0).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } c\text{)} = 81.
\]

### Case 2: \(c = 0\)
- The number takes the form \(ab0\).
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options, since it cannot be 0).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } b\text{)} = 81.
\]

### Step 4: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 \text{ (from case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from case 2)} = 162.
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one 0 is:
\[
\boxed{162}.
\] 

This solution confirms the initial solution's correctness and provides a clear breakdown of the reasoning and calculations involved.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.014484150000000001
